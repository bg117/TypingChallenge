      <Title>US athletes likely to be in safest position to travel to Tokyo Olympics, expert says</Title>
      <Author>Julian Ryall</Author>
      <Level>1</Level>
      <Phrase>As Japan on Tuesday sought to play down the impact of a US travel warning on the Tokyo Olympics, one expert has warned it could “cause concern” for athletes from nations which lack resources to conduct pre-departure tests for their delegations. The US State Department on Monday raised its travel alert for Japan to the highest level of 4, telling citizens “even fully vaccinated travellers may be at risk of getting and spreading Covid-19 variants”. The notice came amid growing domestic opposition to the Games. Olympics organisers reiterated a vow to “ensure the safe and secure participation of all athletes” after the alert, while Japanese officials said they still had the US government’s support for the event, which is scheduled to commence on July 23.</Phrase>

      <Title>Apple employees are going public about workplace issues — and there’s no going back</Title>
      <Author>Zoe Schiffer</Author>
      <Level>2</Level>
      <Phrase>EvenEven to the workers who wrote the letter, the leaks came as a shock. Apple employees rarely speak to the media, particularly about the company culture. In Silicon Valley, Apple operates with an unprecedented level of secrecy, managing personnel issues and product launches with complete authority. The culture has benefits for employees. People work at Apple because they are design fanatics. The elegant hardware products are seen by many as unmatched in the tech industry. Fewer leaks mean fewer distractions and more time to focus on the work. The company also has an aura of prestige. Working at Apple is widely seen as the pinnacle of success in the tech industry, even more than the company’s biggest rivals. If Google is a sprawl of creativity and ideas, Apple represents a workplace of organization and vision. People don’t go there for a few months or a year; they stay for decades. The tenure makes employees loyal.</Phrase>

      <Title>Knockout City’s virtual dodgeball is even more chaotic than the real thing</Title>
      <Author>Jay Peters</Author>
      <Level>3</Level>
      <Phrase>Knockout City took me back to childhood games of dodgeball with a single sound: “whumphf!” That one noise, which you’ll hear a lot as dodgeballs bounce every which way, represents just how well the game’s virtual version of dodgeball mimics the real thing - including all of the chaos you might remember from games on the playground. Knockout City is made by EA and Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit developer Velan Studios, and its primary mode involves three-on-three matches against online opponents. In each match, you’ll scoop up dodgeballs littered around the city-themed maps and launch them at your unsuspecting targets. When you charge up a throw, the game automatically locks onto a target, meaning you don’t have to worry about precise aim. Knockout City is more about timing your shots to try to catch your opponent off-guard, which the game encourages by letting you do things like curve or feint a shot to mix up your tactics.</Phrase>

      <Title>EV startups stumble in the quest to be the next Tesla</Title>
      <Author>Sean O'Kane</Author>
      <Level>4</Level>
      <Phrase>Electric vehicle startups have raised an absurd amount of money in the last year by merging with special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. That money - billions of dollars, collectively - was supposed to be enough to help each of them start fighting for space in a market dominated by Tesla. But many of these startups are still having trouble getting rolling. EV startup struggles are not new. Most of the ones focused on passenger vehicles that are still around spent years grappling with the inherent, unavoidable difficulties of automotive manufacturing. Now, though, the bruises of that fight are developing in broad daylight - all while they try to beat deep-pocketed legacy automakers to the punch. Ohio-based Lordstown Motors raised nearly $700 million when it went public late last year and has backing from America’s largest automaker, General Motors. But it’s spending faster than expected - it lost $125 million in the first quarter - and on Tuesday, the company said it needs more cash in order to hit its goal of making its first 2,200 electric pickup trucks by the end of 2021.</Phrase>

      <Title>Microsoft teases a ‘next generation of Windows’ announcement ‘very soon’</Title>
      <Author>Tom Warren</Author>
      <Level>5</Level>
      <Phrase>Microsoft isn’t talking about its big Windows plans at Build 2021 this week, and that’s because the company is preparing to detail what’s next for its PC operating system separately. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella teased this announcement during his Build keynote this morning, revealing he has been testing “the next generation of Windows” in recent months. “Soon we will share one of the most significant updates to Windows of the past decade to unlock greater economic opportunity for developers and creators. I’ve been self-hosting it over the past several months, and I’m incredibly excited about the next generation of Windows. Our promise to you is this: we will create more opportunity for every Windows developer today and welcome every creator who is looking for the most innovative, new, open platform to build and distribute and monetize applications. We look forward to sharing more very soon.” Microsoft has been working on a new app store for Windows in recent months, alongside some significant UI changes to the operating system. Nadella appears to reference the store changes here, with a promise to unlock a better economy for developers and creators within Windows itself.</Phrase>

      <Title>How Apple’s 2015 negotiations for Time Warner bundling deal briefly led to acquisition talks</Title>
      <Author>Alex Sherman</Author>
      <Level>6</Level>
      <Phrase>As AT&amp;T and Discovery discussed putting together their content assets, they specifically structured a deal to give the combined company flexibility to merge or sell down the road - perhaps to Apple. Apple is one of the few companies that has the balance sheet to buy WarnerMedia-Discovery, a company that will likely have a market capitalization of more than $100 billion when it begins trading publicly next year, assuming regulatory approval. But it’s not clear whether Apple has any interest in a major media acquisition. The company’s history suggests Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook would shy away from a huge deal. Apple’s biggest deal ever was a mere $3 billion - for headphones maker Beats Electronics in 2014. To put that in perspective, Apple has a market valuation of more than $2.1 trillion. Apple’s growing market power is also under increasing scrutiny by regulators and has been the subject of a recently concluded court trial brought by Fortnite maker Epic. Shelling out $100 billion or more for an external company may sound alarm bells with politicians that Cook would rather not ring.</Phrase>

      <Title>Discord CEO on reported Microsoft bid: ‘We did receive a lot of offers.’</Title>
      <Author>Eric Rosenbaum</Author>
      <Level>7</Level>
      <Phrase>It’s been reported that a $10 billion bid made by Microsoft for gaming platform Discord fell apart. Discord CEO and co-founder Jason Citron can’t talk about it - he’s under non-disclosure agreements - but he did tell CNBC on Tuesday that there was more than a single offer for his internet chat start-up, which is turning into a much bigger communications phenomen for voice, video and text. “We did receive a lot of offers,” Citron said. “Our business is doing really well and we believe we are positioned to build a next-generation communications service.” Citron and his Discord co-founder Stanislav Vishnevskiy started the business as a platform for gamers, like Citron himself, frustrated by internet communications technology that he says wasn’t keeping up with the pace of change. Many used services like Microsoft’s Skype to communicate and six years ago, the company was focused on creating a way for people who played video games to hang out and talk to each other in a better way. But a lot has changed. “We’ve seen people take our service and begin using it in all these new ways,” Citron said of the company, which ranked No. 3 on the 2021 CNBC Disruptor 50 list.</Phrase>
